For this specific assignment, I have done all the coding and 
commenting, but both Katherine and Luis did read all the code, 
and we all sat down discussing the code and its behavior. In other words, 
I had the all the primary responsibilities for all the files, 
and Katherine and Luis reviewed all the files.
